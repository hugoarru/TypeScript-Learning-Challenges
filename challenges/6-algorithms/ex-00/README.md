# Countdown Function

## Objective:

Your task is to write a TypeScript function named `countdown` that takes a single number as a parameter and returns an array of numbers counting down from the provided number to 1.

## Function signature

```typescript
export function countdown(count: number): number[];
```

## Instructions:

1. **Create a File**: Create a file named `countdown.ts`.

2. **Define the Function**: Implement the `countdown` function. It should create an array starting from the given `count` parameter and decrementing down to 1.

3. **Export the Function**: Ensure that your function is exported from the module, so it can be imported and tested in other files.

4. **Testing Your Function**: To verify that your function works as expected, use the command below in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm test -- countdown
   ```

5. If the tests pass, your implementation is correct. If not, review and adjust your code as necessary, then retest.

Remember, the focus of this exercise is on loop control and array manipulation in TypeScript. Use the function signature provided as a guideline for your implementation.
